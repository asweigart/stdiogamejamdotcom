STDIO Choice Narrative Engine

for the STDIO Game Jam 2017

The STDIO CNE is a very simple Python script that allows anybody to create a choice-based narrative game.

It also comes with a very simple "example" story, as well as a story written by Victoria for the game jam.

HOW TO RUN IT:

With Python installed, open up a console in the directory with main.py, and type
python main.py

The program will look at any subdirectories that contain a file called "start.txt".
It will then list them for the player, who can choose one to run.
While the story is running, the player can hit the "Enter" key to advance the text.
Sometimes, there will be choices listed, where the player will have to hit a number that corresponds to a choice and hit enter.

HOW TO CREATE STORIES FOR IT:

The easiest way to understand this (terrible, hastily written) format is to look at the files in the included "example" folder.

The file format basically looks like this:

Textblock1
Textblock2
Textblock3
[someOlderChoiceID] ConditionalTextBlock
{choiceText}, Text shown to the user for choice 1, Text shown to the user for choice 2
{choiceIDs} whateverIDForChoice1, whateverIDForChoice2
{labels} filenameForSectionThatChoice1GoesTo filenameForSectionThatChoice2GoesTo

- Essentially the program will print out any normal text blocks
- The text that is shown to the user is COMMA-SEPARATED and comes after the {choiceText} tag (also note that there is a comma AFTER the brackets because I'm lazy)
- The {choiceIDs} tag lets you assign a unique ID to a choice value, that you can then use to display conditional text in a future section
- The {labels} tag specifies which file to go to if the user makes the corresponding choice.  The labels do NOT need the .txt in them, BUT
for every label, there should be a corresponding .txt file.
- If you specify "end" as a label, that will end the story.
- To do conditional text that only shows if a previous choice has been made, you can use square brackets with the choiceID inside.

WOO that's everything.
