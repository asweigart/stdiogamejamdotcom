CHAPTER 1
(You wake up. It is dark. Too dark)
YOU: I can't see! Why can't I see?
GUY: Shhh... Give it a minute.
YOU: No. No! Something's wrong! Call-
(The room comes into focus. Around you is a trashed hotel room.)
GUY: Duuuuude, chiiiiilllll.
(YOU look down, you're a guy)
YOU: Whoa. What'd we do last night? 
GUY: Musta been good. Look at this room, yo.
YOU: Shit. What kinda drug makes you forget you're male?
(GUY looks at you. His eyes are red, you get a shiver)
YOU: Uhhhh... weird question. But- what's my name?
GUY: That's a good question. Basic question. I like that you keep it simple. It's like you're remembering your roots, ya know?
YOU: You don't know, do you?
GUY: I mean, I don't know my name if that makes you feel better.... Maybe this is a gift. It's our opportunity to start over, ya know? Maybe we were killers before and now we can finally do good, start a clean slate.
YOU: You think doing one good thing can wipe out killing someone?
GUY: Gotta start somewhere.
(GUY gets up. He is naked and does a downward dog yoga pose. His back is covered in dried blood)
YOU: Ummmm....
GUY: Oh whoa. Are we gay, bro?
