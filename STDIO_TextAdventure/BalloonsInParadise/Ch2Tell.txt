YOU: Excuse me.
(YOU get the attention of the woman buying the red balloon.)
YOU: I'm so sorry to ask this. But it's my daughter's birthday and red is her favorite color, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind passing on the red balloon today, so that I could get it for my daughter. It's the only thing she's asked for.
MAISY: It's ok, Mom.
WOMAN: Of course, it isn't. You wanted red for your birthday and so you shall have it. Here. On me. Happy birthday!
(WOMAN passes the balloon to MAISY)
YOU: That's so kind!
MAISY: Thank you!
WOMAN: It's just for my grandson, who honestly cares more about the popping the balloon than the color.
(YOU and MAISY leave the store, balloon in hand)
