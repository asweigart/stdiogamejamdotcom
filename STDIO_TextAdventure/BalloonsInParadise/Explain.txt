[Chill] YOU: Hey! You just knocked over my kid!
[Chill] (He turns. He looks vaguely familiar)
[Chill] SAM: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
[Chill] (He stares at you)
[Chill] SAM: Do I know you?
[Chill] YOU: No.
[Chill] SAM: I think- I think I have something for you.
[Chill] (He pulls out his wallet and offers you a wad of bills.)
[Chill] YOU: No, it's ok.
[Chill] SAM: No, I think- I think I'm supposed to.
[Chill] YOU: That's crazy, we can't-
[Chill] SAM: Please, I'm in a hurry.
[Chill] (MAISEY takes it.)
[Chill] YOU: Maisey!
[Chill] SAM: Cute kid.
[Chill] (He runs off)
[Chill] (YOU take the money from MAISEY and count off the bills, it's exactly $1000. YOU and MAISEY scream and count again. YOU rush to the bank. You've got a good feeling about this loan.)
[Kill] YOU: Hey! You just knocked over my kid!
[Kill] (He turns around, he's holding a knife and has blood on his shirt. He cries.)
[Kill] SAM: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
[Kill] YOU: It's- it's ok.
[Kill] SAM: I- I did something bad.
[Kill] YOU: Go inside, Maisey.
[Kill] MAISEY: No.
[Kill] YOU: Go inside and call the police.
[Kill] (MAISEY goes.)
[Kill] SAM: I- I think I called my brother. I was wasted and I â€“ he was freaking me out and I- I stabbed him.
[Kill] YOU: Ok. Let's throw the knife away, ok?
[Kill] (SAM throws the knife)
[Kill] (YOU can hear the distant sound of sirens. News coverage comes. You miss your bank loan interview but are upheld as a local hero. MAISEY tells you it's her best birthday yet.)
