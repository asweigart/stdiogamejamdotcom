(The WOMAN leaves the store with the red balloon)
YOU: I don't suppose you have a red balloon?
CASHIER: Sorry, just sold the last one.
YOU: I'm sorry, honey. Is there another color I can get you?
(For just a moment, MAISY's veneer flashes disappointment. You know it's not that she needs a red balloon but just that, for once, she'd want you to come through on what you promised. MAISY quickly hides her disappointment.)
MAISY: It's just a balloon, Mom. Whatever is fine.
YOU: Well, you can choose.
MAISY: Green.
(YOU get a green balloon and walk out the store. MAISEY is happy again. You're not sure how you got such a great kid.)
